# My Balcony Container Garden Setup

Who says you need a yard to grow your own food? Here's how I turned my small balcony into a productive garden.

## The Challenge

My balcony faces east, so I get about 6 hours of morning sun. Not ideal for all vegetables, but enough for many!

**Space:** 4ft x 8ft balcony
**Sunlight:** 6 hours morning sun
**Climate:** Zone 7b

## What I'm Growing

### Herbs (always a win!)
- Basil
- Mint
- Parsley
- Chives

### Vegetables
- Cherry tomatoes (in 5-gallon buckets)
- Lettuce (in window boxes)
- Radishes (quick and easy!)
- Green onions (grow from scraps!)

## Container Tips

**Size matters:**
- Tomatoes need at least 5 gallons
- Herbs do fine in 1-2 gallon pots
- Lettuce thrives in shallow, wide containers

**Drainage is crucial:**
Always use pots with drainage holes. Always.

## Lessons from Year One

**What worked:**
- Cherry tomatoes produced like crazy
- Herbs were unstoppable
- Succession planting lettuce gave continuous harvest

**What didn't:**
- Full-size tomatoes struggled (not enough root space)
- Peppers needed more sun than I could provide
- Forgot to water during heat wave... RIP basil batch #1

## My Setup

- 4 large fabric grow bags (tomatoes)
- 2 long window boxes (lettuce, radishes)
- 6 terracotta pots (herbs)
- Self-watering spikes (lifesaver!)

**Best investment:** A small watering can with a long spout. Makes reaching back pots so much easier!

Next year I'm adding a vertical trellis for climbing beans. Work smarter, not harder!
