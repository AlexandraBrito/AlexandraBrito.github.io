This November I decided to break the phone addiction and move my leisure time into some more rewarding and physical hobbies. I spent this month for the major part painting sewing and playing card games.

After watching Alison youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axVwB2tRDDM&list=LL&index=9&pp=gAQBiAQB About how she set herself the challenge for October to be fully analog and try and consume mostly analog stuff. I truly felt inspired, a decided It was time for me to also take into my own hands what I want to consume instead of leaving it to the algorithm.

- My goal is to break the short reward, and move more into a long reward

Here is how I occupied myself during this what felt the longest month ever in a good way because I had so much time and did so much.

### Riftbound

First off I learned my first TCG (trading card game) and Its really fun and really annoying depending if I'm wining or losing. While Playing this game I realized how competitive I can be, and that maybe me not really liking specific games is maybe because I rally don't like wining, and the entry price in so games means you loose tons when you're a beginner.

### Design a shirt in Clo3d

### Continued a paint by number I started a year ago

### Animal crossing is a fall game

### Made some clothes and refined my Pinterest/style

### Consumed some written content

Honestly this experience has been very fun. The ideia of looking your self into what you want to watch and enjoy is not only very rewarding, but also leaves with a sense of connection to whatever you might find. Left me more open to search about what I want to learn and actually do the thing I enjoy. Ans also learn them. It also makes you also consume content for things you want to learn and not only what capture your attention. tis Month I also felt like starting hard tasks way easier, like the process of starting my day job easier. since I had feed myself of the fat rewarding cycle.
