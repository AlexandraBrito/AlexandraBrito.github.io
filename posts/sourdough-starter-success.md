# Sourdough Starter Success (Finally!)

After three failed attempts over two years, I finally have a thriving sourdough starter. Here's what I learned.

## Attempt 1: Too Cold

**What happened:** Starter never got active
**Why:** Kept it in a cold kitchen in winter
**Lesson:** Sourdough needs warmth (70-80°F is ideal)

## Attempt 2: Gave Up Too Soon

**What happened:** Threw it out after 4 days
**Why:** Didn't see bubbles
**Lesson:** It can take 7-14 days to establish!

## Attempt 3: The Charm

**What I did differently:**
- Used whole wheat flour for the first few days (more wild yeast)
- Kept it on top of the fridge (warmer spot)
- Fed it consistently at the same time every day
- Marked the jar to track growth

## My Feeding Schedule

**Days 1-5:**
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 50g water
- Mix, discard half daily

**Days 6+:**
- Switched to bread flour
- Same 1:1 ratio
- Started seeing consistent doubling!

## First Bake

My first loaf wasn't Instagram-perfect, but it was MINE. The crust crackled, the crumb was open enough, and the taste? Incredible.

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Be patient** - It takes time
2. **Consistency matters** - Feed at the same time
3. **Watch for doubling** - Not just bubbles
4. **Start simple** - No-knead recipes are your friend
5. **Name your starter** - Mine's called "Doughy Parton"

The learning curve is steep, but homemade sourdough is worth every failed attempt!
