# Sewing Basics: How to Read a Pattern

When I first started sewing, patterns looked like hieroglyphics. Here's what I wish someone had told me from the start.

## Pattern Markings Explained

### The Grain Line
This arrow shows you how to align your pattern piece with the fabric grain. Always, always follow this!

### Notches
Those little triangles on the edges? They help you match pieces together. Single notch matches single notch, double matches double.

### Dots and Circles
These mark important points like dart ends or where to pivot your sewing.

## Size Selection

Don't use your ready-to-wear size! Measure yourself:
- Bust
- Waist
- Hips

Then compare to the pattern's measurement chart.

## Common Symbols

- Dashed lines = fold lines
- Scissors symbol = cut here
- "CF" = center front
- "CB" = center back

**Pro tip:** Trace your pattern onto paper before cutting. That way you can use it multiple times in different sizes!
